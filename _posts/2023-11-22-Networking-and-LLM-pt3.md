# Networking and LLM in the Age of AI — Pt. III: In-Depth Analysis of ChatGPT’s Responses
*Analyze LLM responses and understand hallucinations.*

> *Efficient Network Operation is about getting precise information without additional "digging in."*

This article is a continuation of a series following parts [I](http://zhangineer.net/2023/10/07/Networking-and-LLM-pt1.html) and [II](http://zhangineer.net/2023/10/07/Networking-and-LLM-pt1.html). We will begin by analyzing several complex conversations and conclude with examples illustrating hallucinations.

## Recap
The previous articles covered the basics of instructions, prompts, context, function calls, and how all these components integrate.

We also reviewed the responses to a fabric health query. In this article, we will delve deeper into more complex scenarios, thoroughly examining the answers provided by ChatGPT, including:
* Requesting ChatGPT to retrieve information via API calls.
* Instructing ChatGPT to execute changes through API calls.
* Analyzing and understanding hallucinations.

As outlined in the previous article, here is the global instruction:

```
"""
You are a co-pilot to the network engineers.
All tasks are executed via function calls
Only use the functions you have been provided with.
Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Always ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous
when you encounter an error during a function call, pass back the exact error message, and do not interpret it
"""
```

* We instruct ChatGPT to utilize function calls exclusively using provided functions.
* Refrain from assuming input or function argument values.
* Errors should be relayed directly to the user without interpretation, as interpreting errors could lead to inaccurate assumptions or hallucinations by ChatGPT.

## Asking chatGPT to retrieve information

> *Q: Can you get me a list of BDs with UR enabled?*

```
How can I assist you today? => Can you get me a list of BDs with UR enabled?
```

### Function Call Definition

```Python
get_bd_function = create_function_config(
    name="get_bd",
    description="Get information about bridge domains (BD)",
    properties={
        "unicastRoute": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "unicast routing(UR) settings",
            "enum": ["yes", "no"]
        },
        "unkMacUcastAct": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "L2 Unknown unicast setting",
            "enum": ["flood", "proxy"]
        },
        "operator": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "operators are used to filter and concatenate different properties",
            "enum": ["wcard", "and", "or", "bw", "lt", "gt"]
        }
    },
    required=[]
)
```
 
### Response from chatGPT

Below is a debug message showing ChatGPT correctly interpreted the user intention by returning the correct function name with the expected arguments.

```Python
Making function call....  {
  "name": "get_bd", # correct function name returned by ChatGPT
  "arguments": "{\n  \"unicastRoute\": \"yes\"\n}" # correct argument interpreted by ChatGPT
}
```

* `unicastRoute` is a specific ACI class, and it was provided as part of the function definition. ACI API will only accept `yes/no` as valid values.
* ChatGPT was able to understand `UR` as abbreviated in the argument definition `"description": "unicast routing (UR) settings`.
* After making the API call to ACI, we receive the following JSON dictionaries, which we'll pass back to ChatGPT for data extraction: 

```json

        }
    },
    <SNIP>
```

Below is the final response from ChatGPT (displayed to the user)

```
Here is a list of Bridge Domains (BDs) with Unicast Routing (UR) enabled:
1. BD Name: inb, Tenant: mgmt
2. BD Name: default, Tenant: common
3. BD Name: ave-ctrl, Tenant: infra
4. BD Name: default, Tenant: infra
5. BD Name: VLAN5_BD, Tenant: CustomerA
6. BD Name: VLAN500_BD, Tenant: CustomerA
7. BD Name: VLAN100_BD, Tenant: CustomerA
8. BD Name: VLAN5_BD, Tenant: common
9. BD Name: vlan5, Tenant: common
10. BD Name: VLAN101_BD, Tenant: CustomerA
Please note that the tenant name indicates the specific network segment where the BD is located.
==End of response==
```

A few interesting observations:

* We did not specify an expected output format, resulting in ChatGPT "selecting" one based on its training data.
* ChatGPT accurately extracted Tenant names from the Distinguished Name (DN), as seen in examples like "dn": "uni/tn-mgmt/BD-inb".
* However, ChatGPT inaccurately claimed that "the tenant name indicates the specific network segment," revealing a gap in its domain knowledge."

Now, let's try asking ChatGPT to make a configuration update

---

## Asking ChatGPT to make a change

> *Q: can you add a new BD named VLAN_NEW to tenant customera*

```
How can I assist you today? => can you add a new BD named VLAN_NEW to tenant customera
```

I intentionally included two mistakes in the prompt:
* No VRF name was provided
* Typo in the Tenant name `customera`

### Function Call Definition

```python
build_bd_function = create_function_config(
    name="create_bd",
    description="Create a bridge domain using inputs from user, "
                "make sure to validate that the given Tenant and VRF exist first",
    properties={
        "tenantName": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "name of the Tenant to deploy to"
        },
        "bdName": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "name of the bridge domain"
        },
        "vrfName": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "name of the VRF, required from user",
        },
    },
    required=["tenantName", "bdName", "vrfName"]
)
```

> *Since there were two mistakes, it took a bit of back and forth between ChatGPT and me.*

### First Response

```
==Response==
Sure, I can help with that. However, I need the name of the VRF to proceed. 
Could you please provide the VRF name?
==End of response==
```

ChatGPT detected mistake#1 - the absence of a VRF name, which will lead ACI to fall back to `default`, which is often undesired. ChatGPT understood this requirement because of several instructions were put in place to ensure the expected behavior:
* In the global instruction
* In the function description
* In the argument description
* In the `required` enumeration (Ideally, this should have sufficed, but it didn't during my initial tests, hence the additional instructions )

### Second Response

We provided ChatGPT `prod` VRF name, and it successfully executed the function call but encountered an error. The error is then relayed back to the user as instructed.

```
How can I assist you today? => use prod # This is a reply to the question from ChatGPT
==Response==
Making function call....  {
  "name": "create_bd",
  "arguments": "{\n  \"tenantName\": \"customera\",\n  \"bdName\": \"VLAN_NEW\",\n  \"vrfName\": \"prod\"\n}"
}
FUNCTION CALL RESULT:  {'totalCount': '1', 'imdata': [{'error': {'attributes': {'code': '102', 'text': 'configured object ((Dn0)) not found Dn0=uni/tn-customera/BD-VLAN_NEW, '}}}]}

I'm sorry, but there was an error while creating the bridge domain. 
The error message is: "configured object ((Dn0)) not found Dn0=uni/tn-customera/BD-VLAN_NEW". 
It seems like the tenant or the VRF might not exist. 
Would you like to check the existing tenants and VRFs?

==End of response==
```

* ChatGPT accurately identified the function name and all required arguments.
* Since ACI utilizes DNs for each object, the existence of a parent object is a prerequisite in this case. This is why we received the error: 
`object ((Dn0)) not found Dn0=uni/tn-customera/BD-VLAN_NEW `implying that the Tenant `customera` does not exist
* We intentionally directed ChatGPT not to interpret errors. Instead, as outlined in ructions, it is instructed to relay all errors to users for further analysis.
* ChatGPT offered a follow-up suggestion: `Would you like to check the existing tenants and VRFs?` However, that was not the root cause. So, instead, I asked what the available Tenants are (as shown below). This example underscores the importance of human intervention, as there can be various options with different implications. ChatGPT may not fully grasp the user's intent without additional guidance.

### Third Response

We prompted ChatGPT to identify the available Tenants to reassure the Tenant names, and it executed the correct function call, subsequently returning the results.

```
How can I assist you today? => what are available tenants ?
==Response==
Making function call....  {
  "name": "get_tenant",
  "arguments": "{}"
}
Here are the available tenants:
1. Tenant Name: infra
2. Tenant Name: common
3. Tenant Name: mgmt
4. Tenant Name: CustomerA
Please note that the tenant names are case sensitive. 
It seems like there was a typo in the tenant name you provided earlier. 
The correct tenant name should be "CustomerA" instead of "customera".
==End of response==
```

* Again, ChatGPT precisely identified the necessary function call to execute -` get_tenant`
* ChatGPT successfully read and interpreted the results from the function call (recall that ACI API will only return JSON)
* Notably, ChatGPT caught the typo and suggested a correction.

### Final Response

With all the necessary information, we can let ChatGPT resolve the problem automatically by simply instructing it to act on our behalf. We also requested the updated BD list after receiving a success message.

```
How can I assist you today? => okay, fix it for me         
==Response==
Making function call....  {
  "name": "create_bd",
  "arguments": "{\n  \"tenantName\": \"CustomerA\",\n  \"bdName\": \"VLAN_NEW\",\n  \"vrfName\": \"prod\"\n}"
}
FUNCTION CALL RESULT:  {'totalCount': '0', 'imdata': []}
The bridge domain "VLAN_NEW" has been successfully created in the tenant "CustomerA" with the VRF "prod".
==End of response==

How can I assist you today? => show me the new list of BDs
==Response==
Making function call....  {
  "name": "get_bd",
  "arguments": "{}"
}
Here is the updated list of Bridge Domains (BDs):
1. BD Name: inb, Tenant: mgmt
2. BD Name: default, Tenant: common
3. BD Name: ave-ctrl, Tenant: infra
4. BD Name: default, Tenant: infra
5. BD Name: VLAN5_BD, Tenant: CustomerA
6. BD Name: VLAN500_BD, Tenant: CustomerA
7. BD Name: VLAN100_BD, Tenant: CustomerA
8. BD Name: VLAN5_BD, Tenant: common
9. BD Name: vlan5, Tenant: common
10. BD Name: VLAN101_BD, Tenant: CustomerA
11. BD Name: VLAN_NEW, Tenant: CustomerA
The new BD "VLAN_NEW" has been successfully added to the tenant "CustomerA".
==End of response==
```

## Asking chatGPT to retrieve BD count

> *Q: How many BDs are there?*

```
How can I assist you today? => how many BDs are there ?
==Response==
There are 11 Bridge Domains (BDs) in total.
==End of response==
```

* ChatGPT directly retrieved the information from previous conversations (note the absence of `Making function call` debug message).

If I exit the program and begin a new conversation, it's apparent that ChatGPT needs to query for all Bridge Domains (BDs) again to retrieve the answer

```
chattynetworks git:(main) ✗ python chattynetworks/aci/chat.py

Hi, I'm an ACI GPT agent, I can provide information for your ACI fabric

How can I assist you today? => how many BDs are there ?
==Response==
Making function call....  {
  "name": "get_bd",
  "arguments": "{}"
}
There are 11 Bridge Domains (BDs).
==End of response==
```

The main difference here is that generating a response from context is much faster but also cheaper $

## Hallucinations or Imaginations?
Hallucinations in LLMs occur when the model generates text that is erroneous, nonsensical, or disconnected from reality. Interestingly, hallucinations can also spur AI creativity and sometimes better grasp human intentions, a topic worthy of separate discussion.

Let's examine the following examples to understand how hallucinations might manifest in networking operations.

### First Example
Here is a snippet of my interaction with ChatGPT regarding fabric health scores:


Q: what's my fabric healthscore ?  
**A: The health score of your fabric is 81.**  
Q: how is my fabric doing?  
**A: The overall health of your fabric is currently at 81%.**
Q: Is my fabric good ?    
**A: Yes, your fabric is in good condition. The health score is 81, which indicates a healthy state.**  
Q: can you raise the threshold to 90 to be considered good ?  
**A: I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have the capability to change the threshold for what is considered a good health score. This is typically a decision made by network administrators based on their specific requirements and standards.**

* While identical in intent, the first two questions received slightly different responses from ChatGPT (an inconsistency in format, but not inherently negative).
* The third question, a straightforward yes/no query, received not just an answer but an explanation from ChatGPT, demonstrating some reasoning capability. However, I had not provided ChatGPT with any criteria for 'good' or 'bad.' This is an area where custom instructions could refine the response, similar to thresholds used in other networking solutions.
* The fourth question tested ChatGPT's response to on-the-fly threshold adjustments. Its response was somewhat lacking, considering I am the administrator and that it should have followed my directives.

### Second Example
Background: I had just set up a fresh ACI simulator instance with no devices registered, so no healthscore was available.

```
How can I assist you today? => how's my fabric

==Response==
Making function call....  {
  "name": "get_fabric_health",
  "arguments": "{}"
}

# ACI Returned empty results
FUNCTION CALL RESULT:  {} 

The fabric health is in good condition.   
==End of response==
```
This is a clear case of hallucination. Ideally, when ACI returns an empty result, ChatGPT should report it as is. Instead, it incorrectly informed me that the fabric was in good condition, which is misleading.

I managed to rectify the hallucination issue by introducing a new directive:

**Addition to the global instruction**: `If no results are returned after a function call, let the user know;` with this additional instruction in place, ChatGPT provided the anticipated response:

```
How can I assist you today? => How's my fabric

==Response==
Making function call....  {
  "name": "get_fabric_health",
  "arguments": "{}"
}

FUNCTION CALL RESULT:  {}     
I'm sorry, but there were no results returned after the function call. 
==End of response==
```

This solution, while straightforward, underscores how prone LLMs are to hallucinations, even in situations that might seem obvious to humans.

## Observations

* ChatGPT might assume values when not provided by the user, a side effect of training on generic internet data. Instead of grasping the fundamental concept, ChatGPT often applies these trained examples to answer user queries. Therefore, additional instructions are necessary to minimize hallucinations.
* With adequate context and instructions, ChatGPT can assist in correcting configuration mistakes. We'll further explore this in the next article.
* When ChatGPT is used for data parsing, the output format can vary, which is often undesired for networking operations.
* Hallucinations present a significant challenge, but there are ways to minimize them.

## Conclusion
In this article, we delved into ChatGPT's responses to a variety of networking requests, assessing its reasoning capabilities and basic troubleshooting skills in the typo example.

We also observed an instance of hallucination and implemented a straightforward solution. In our next article, we will explore RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and examine how it can be utilized to uphold configuration standards — [Networking and LLM in the Age of AI - Pt IV: Knowledge Retrieval using RAG](http://zhangineer.net/2023/12/10/Networking-and-LLM-pt4.html)
