      <description>System Instructions are more potent than you might realize
I have seen many posts from Network Engineers and Architects dismissing LLM’s ability to perform domain-specific tasks. While it is true that a generic LLM software like ChatGPT does not possess the same level of domain knowledge, it has a high potential to outperform humans if given proper guidance and some teaching.
In this post, I will cut through the noise and examine how to “teach” chatGP to answer domain-specific questions like an expert.</description>

      <description>Analyze LLM responses and understand hallucinations.
Efficient Network Operation is about getting precise information without additional &amp;ldquo;digging in.&amp;rdquo;
This article is a continuation of a series following parts I and II. We will begin by analyzing several complex conversations and conclude with examples illustrating hallucinations.
Recap The previous articles covered the basics of instructions, prompts, context, function calls, and how all these components integrate.
We also reviewed the responses to a fabric health query.</description>

      <description>Instructions, Context, Function Calling and Prompts
The most crucial information we must provide to any LLM chat model are the context, detailed instructions, and precise prompts.
This article is part of a series — You can find Part I here
Instructions Instructions play a crucial role in shaping an LLM into a valuable assistant. Their purpose is to set clear expectations and guide narratives and context, thereby reducing inaccuracies and ensuring more precise responses.</description>

      <description>15 years of experience in the networking field, specializing in Software-Defined Networking (SDN), I have recently delved into the world of AI/ML. My focus has been on researching the applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in networking, exploring how these advanced technologies can supercharge networking and user experiences.
Experiences Most recent first
2 years working in a startup building a Networking AI/ML product 4 years as solutions architect / consultant / pre-sale in networking, specifically Cisco ACI and DataCenter 5 years as a network engineer in Enterprise covering a wide range of technologies - DC/Campus Networking, CDN, Automation 5 years as a tier-1 tech support engineer in an ISP setting White Papers Published Segmenting Complex Environments Using Cisco ACI Demystifying ACI Application Centric &amp;ldquo;Mode&amp;rdquo; Through the Lens of an Engineer Cisco ACI: Design to Automate Career Certifications and Awards Patent: US11606265B2 - Network control in artificial intelligence-defined networking Awarded by WWT as Engineer of the Month/Quarter/Year in 2021 Cisco Certified Network Associate Cisco Certified DevNet Associate Cisco Certified DevNet Professional Cisco Certified DevNet Specialist - Core Cisco Certified DevNet Specialist - Data Center Automation and Programmability Coursera - Generative AI with LLM Coursera - Generative AI for everyone Coursera - Machine Learning Coursera - AI For Everyone My Thoughts On AI My primary goal is to harness the power of LLMs to facilitate the integration of AI/ML into data center designs, effectively bridging the gap between high-level business requirements and network functionalities.</description>

      <description>A series to explore how to leverage LLM for networking tasks
The rise of chatGPT and large language models (LLM) has opened up the possibility of transforming various domains. However, networking remains largely unexplored.
In this series, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the potential of LLMs to empower Networking Operations. No AI/ML knowledge is required.
For the Busy People - TL;DR For the Series LLM demonstrated significant promise in assisting with IT and networking configuration management and troubleshooting tasks.</description>
