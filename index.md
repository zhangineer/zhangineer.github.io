Welcome to the exciting journey of exploring AI/ML in networking! My blog delves into the transformative potential of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) in networking, covering a range of topics from networking management and troubleshooting to design assistance.

I firmly believe AI is here to augment, not to replace, network engineers. It’s akin to the calculator's role in mathematics: a powerful tool that expands capabilities without diminishing the importance of human expertise. The calculator didn’t replace mathematicians; instead, it made math more accessible and accelerated our learning.

Similarly, while the core principles of networking remain crucial, our approach evolves. Engineers need a solid grasp of these fundamentals to discern when an LLM might 'hallucinate'. The shift we’re witnessing moves us away from rote memorization of CLI commands towards a focus on design and business alignment. Our goal is to provide nuanced, business-specific directives to LLMs, enhancing efficiency and customization.

Envision a future where networking operations are driven more by human language interfaces than traditional CLI/GUI. This paradigm shift promises a more intuitive, human-centric approach to networking technology
