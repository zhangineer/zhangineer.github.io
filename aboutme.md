# About Me

I have over a decade of experience in networking. For the past few years I started picking up AI/ML and has been working on a project to apply AI/ML to Networking for the past 2 years.

I enjoy reading, learning and applying AI/ML, especially LLM in the filed of networking. Mostly using language models to drive the adoption of AI/ML in the data center and connect highly abstracted business requirements directly to networking intent. True intent based networking is about the business and applications, beyond the network itself.
